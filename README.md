# Welcome to my web dev portfolio!

Hey there! If you're reading this, I'm assuming you're taking a look at my portfolio's source code on Github - welcome!

You might have already noticed, but there's a little more here than I have linked to from my main page. For reference:

- `/culture/`, `/dailyReadings/`, and `/dnd/` are all old projects from college courses; they're not much to look at, but I've saved them here mainly to have a good laugh (& to see how far I've come!)
- `/gcsp/` is a (mostly) finished summary of a research project I assisted Dr. Jeffrey Walters with for the Grand Challenges Scholars Program; my work wasn't ultimately used in the final research, but in the process I learned a lot about academia, presentations, and the way computer science can fit into humanitarian work and research.
- `/whatCanAustinAndKimberlyEat/` is the very first rough implementation of [Meat and Right](https://www.meatandright.com/) that I created for my husband and I, before I decided to turn it into a React application & make it a more universally-applicable tool!
