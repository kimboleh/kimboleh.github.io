          <h1>Interdisciplinary Curriculum</h1>

          <h2>George Fox Honors Program</h2>
            <p>Easily one of the most influential aspects of my education, the
            <a href="https://www.georgefox.edu/honors-program/index.html">George Fox Honors Program</a> is a
            Great Books curriculum that has walked my graduating class through four years of texts that
            have shaped history. Topics range from philosophy to economics, from Homer's <em>Iliad</em>
            to Sartre's <em>Existentialism is a Humanism</em>, and we discuss a different text twice a week
            in a rountable, Socratic format.</p>
            <p>Now, while picking up a copy of Augustine or Descartes is usually not a direct map onto engineering
            or research work, the skills I have picked up over the course of this program are ones
            I will always find invaluable: I've learned to contribute well to group discussions,
            to think critically about nuanced ideas, and to hold different opinions and schools of thought
            in my head and discuss them articulately. In global humanitarian work,
            it is a guarentee that you will have interactions with people different than yourself. I believe
            it is imperative that we be able to have meaningful, progressive conversations about the
            nuanced issues we work with in this field, and my time in the Honors Program has given me a
            passion for thoughtful communication.

          <h2>Computer Science</h2>
            <p>The spectrum of experience I've had during my time in George Fox's Computer Science department
            is incredibly wide and absolutely invaluable. The courses have fairly standard content: data structures,
            design patterns, databases; but what's really made the experience has been our faculty.</p>
            <p>I wouldn't have switched into a CSIS major without the <strike>pressure</strike> encouragement
            of multiple professors in the department--and once I switched, the care they had for me personally
            didn't go away just because I'd 'converted'. I've felt like I've had people to go to for advice
            every step of the way, and I can honestly say I've never once doubted my decision to switch.</p>

          <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>Though there aren't many obvious ties to my computer and engineering work, talking about
              my education without mentioning music would make this section entirely incomplete.</p>
            <p>I began my education as a Music Composition major; I love to make music, and I love the
              creativity and problem-solving needed to weave musical lines together. I actually loved my Theory
              classes for the same reason I loved my programming ones - I had to think, and I had to use
              nearly every part of my brain to do it. I'm a soprano and love to sing, and I also play a fairly
              wide repertoire of instruments: flute, tuba, euphonium/baritone, guitar, and a smattering of
              saxophone, piano, and bass drum.</p>
            <p>Should you want to hear me wax poetic about music and why I love it, you can read <a href="http://kimberlynachbur.com/why-do-you-love-music/">
              this old blog post</a> I wrote about that very subject, back before I'd ever switched majors; but despite
              my change in career trajectory, everything there rings true. <em>If I don't study music, I am
              not myself.</em> There's a lot more to life than lines of code running across my screen,
              and for that I am truly grateful.</p>
